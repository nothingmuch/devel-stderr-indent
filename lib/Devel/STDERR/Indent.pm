=head1 NAME

Devel::STDERR::Indent - Indents STDERR to aid in print-debugging recursive algorithms.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Devel::STDERR::Indent qw/indent/;

	sub factorial {
		my $h = indent; # causes indentation

		my $n = shift;
		warn "computing factorial $n"; # indented based on call depth

		if ($n == 0) {
			return 1
		} else {
			my $got = factorial($n - 1);
			warn "got back $got, multiplying by $n";
			return $n * $got;
		}
	}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

When debugging recursive code it's very usefl to indent traces, but often too
much trouble.

This module makes automates the indentation. When you call the C<indent>
function the indentation level is increased for as long as you keep the value
you got back. Once that goes out of scope the indentation level is decreased
again.

=head1 EXPORTS

All exports are optional, and may be accessed fully qualified instead.

=over 4

=head1 indent

Returns an object which you keep around for as long as you want another indent
level:

	my $h = $indent;
	# ... all warnings are indented by one additional level
	$h = undef; # one indentation level removed

Instantiates a new indentation guard and calls C<enter> on it before returning it.

Parameters are passed to C<new>:

	indent "foo"; # will print enter/leave messages too

=head1 METHODS

=over1

=item new

Creates the indentation helper, but does not install it yet.

If given a single argument it is assumed to be for the C<message> attribute.

=item emit

Output a warning with the previous installed hook.

=item format

Indent a message.

=item warn

Calls C<format> and then C<emit>.

=item enter

Calls C<install> the hook and outputs the optional message.

=item leave

Calls C<uninstall> the hook and outputs the optional message.

=item install

Installs the hook in C<$SIG{__WARN__}>.

=item uninstall

Uninstalls the hook restoring the previous value.

=back

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over 4

=item message

If supplied will be printed in C<enter> prefixed by C<enter_string> and in
C<leave> prefixed by C<leave_string>.

=item indent_string

Defaults to C<'    '> (four spaces).

=item enter_string

Defaults to C<< ' -> ' >>.

=item leave_string

Defaults to C<< ' <- ' >>.
