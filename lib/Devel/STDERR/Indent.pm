=head1 NAME

Devel::STDERR::Indent - Indents STDERR to aid in print-debugging recursive algorithms.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Devel::STDERR::Indent qw/indent/;

	sub factorial {
		my $h = indent; # causes indentation

		my $n = shift;
		warn "computing factorial $n"; # indented based on call depth

		if ($n == 0) {
			return 1
		} else {
			my $got = factorial($n - 1);
			warn "got back $got, multiplying by $n";
			return $n * $got;
		}
	}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

When debugging recursive code it's useful, but often too much trouble to have
your traces indented.

This module makes it easy - call the indent function, and keep the thing you
got back around until the sub exits.

This will wrap $SIG{__WARN__} with something that adds as many repetitions of
C<$Devel::STDERR::Indent::STRING> as there are live instances of the class
(minus one):

	s/^/$STRING x ($count - 1)/ge

When the handle is destroyed (due to garbage collection), $count is
decremented.

=head1 EXPORTS

All exports are optional, and may be accessed fully qualified instead.

=over 4

=head1 indent

Returns an object which you keep around for as long as you want another indent
level:

	my $h = $indent;
	# ... all warnings are indented by one additional level
	$h = undef; # one indentation level removed

=head1 $STRING

The string to repeat (defaults to C<"\t">).
